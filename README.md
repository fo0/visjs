visjs-network
=====


This is a fork of the great visjs addon by [Sameera Roshan](https://github.com/sameeraroshan/visjs) for Vaadin
----

[Vis.js](http://visjs.org) is a dynamic, browser based visualization library. The library uses JSON for configuration and communication. This fork implements the **latest vis.js network module (4.0)** version for **Vaadin 8.1**.

It only implements the network module, because all other charts provided by vis.js are already captured by Vaadin Charts.

The vis.js library is developed by Almende B.V, as part of CHAP. Vis.js runs fine on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE9+, and most mobile browsers (with full touch support).
